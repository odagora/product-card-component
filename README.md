## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

Use of CSS Grid responsively without the need of Media Queries
```css
.product-container {
    position: relative;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(375px, 1fr));
}
```
`overflow` property to display correctly an image inside a parent component with a `border-radius`
```css
.product-container {
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
Use of accesibility text for screen readers
```html
<p class="product__price">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Current price:</span>
  $149.99
</p>
```
```css
.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    clip-path: inset(50%);
    height: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: absolute;
    white-space: nowrap;
    width: 1px;
}
```
### Continued development

- Use of preprocessors like SASS for styling
- Use of CSS Grid in complex layouts
- Use of transformations and animations with CSS
